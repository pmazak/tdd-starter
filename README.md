A TDD Starter App
======
**Requires** [Gradle][gradle] (0.9+) to build/run.   
Built for a TDD class where everyone uses Eclipse. (Updated to work with IntelliJ!)   
Code generation for a single Groovy and Java source and unit test.   
For extra flare, [Crap4J][crap4j] is tied to the test task for TDD competitions. Who has the least crap?!   

First time only
